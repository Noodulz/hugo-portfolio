Hi hi! Welcome to my page where I publish all my projects, devlogs, and publications. I am an ML Researcher and Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience in designing webpages, creating accessible features for clients, and programming things here and there. Currently my research focus is in copyright in AI and detecting synthetically-made artwork with convolutional neural networks.

My interests vary widely from machine learning, computer graphics, to compilers and full-stack development. So I maintain this site to document my understanding of how things work, showcasing what I make as I go, and maybe some occasional random reviews and facts I find interesting :D
